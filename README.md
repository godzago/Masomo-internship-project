# Masomo-internship-project
Masomo internship project summary 

During my recent internship, I underwent comprehensive training in Unity elements and game development, significantly enhancing my proficiency in game mechanics, graphic design, and coding. Engaging in collaborative projects within the Unity game engine alongside my teammates, I honed my communication and teamwork skills. My active involvement in the game design and Game Design Document (GDD) processes allowed me to contribute significantly to shaping the basic mechanics, storyline, and gameplay elements of our projects. This internship experience not only expanded my technical capabilities but also bolstered my ability to effectively collaborate and communicate within a team environment.
